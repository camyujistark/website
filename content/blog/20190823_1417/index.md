For the last few months, I have been trying to get into larger web companies. It has been difficult to say the least. From getting your head around TDD, to how you go about take home coding tests that you have to extend later on with in-house developers, it is one of the biggest challenges I have faced of recent times. While you think that I would be discouraged, I am more determined then ever to get passed this barrier.

I really learnt things the hard way. I sent out my resume to around 10 companies, of which I was able to have interview with 4, 2 going onto pairing exercises, 1 with a potential offer that fell through. By all means, I don't think that I am a bad coder. But I know that I have some shortcomings when aiming for more mid to senior positions with larger apps. 

I am excited that I have so much I can improve - that I am pushing to become a better coder. Being self-taught and working at agencies through out my career, I have not been challenged enough in getting jobs where I will be expanding my knowledge more.

I am basing this post from a fantastic github repo [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/dg92/coding-interview-university), where the writer explains his intentions to work for larger company and to become a Software Engineer. It is going to be a long road. But it really is quite amazing. For the longest time I did not have 100% goal in mind. This is it.

### Top wins I made when looking for work

- Make connections. Network
- Relax. be nice
- Learn from each test. You are getting feedback for free. You can become better.
- Make side projects and work on your coding style.
- Use what you learnt from one test to another.
- Keep positive. Use negative energy to do positive things. ended up going from 85wpm to 95wpm during this time.
- Talk to others. Let go of your ego and explain to others that you are going through an adventure.

### Top mistakes I made when trying to get work

- Code tests are not there so you can finish asap. Majority of time you are writing something that you need to extend later on.
- If you are not familiar with tests and writing in TDD, make sure you make this a habit. Make projects with this in mind. You will be tested.
- Anywhere you write about yourself, even on Linkedin, could be used against you at an intereview. Make sure that you don't say anything that can be used against you.
- Make queue cards with technical knowledge. Make sure that you keep revising
- Get sleep!
- Rehearse Rehearse Rehearse
- Don't get disheartend if you don't get the job. There are plenty out there. Just keep at it. I was especially broken down with some of my first job application rejections. But keep going, you will build a tolerance by the second one.
